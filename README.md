# CatWebsiteFlask
Simple Web Development with the use of HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask.
I created this website for my cat, Boo. I used HTML for the user interface, and Python3 (import requests) to pull JSON files for details such as the updated weather in our hometown. Lastly, I used Flask to integrate both languages and to create a local host, and thus a website was born.
